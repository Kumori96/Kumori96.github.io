        <div><p class="about1">Greetings and welcome to my website! My name is Kevin Chung and I am a junior undergraduate student studying computer science at UC Davis. I enjoy learning more about various topics in computer science and am currently trying to find a specialization in the field that I like best. I enjoy coding and have a passion to constantly learn more.</p>
        <p class="about2">Aside from computer science, I have passions for various other topics. I really enjoy tech in general and consider myself very tech-savvy. I build computers for fun and love taking things apart. I have a deep love for the piano with 14 years of classical and jazz experience. In particular, I love jazz improvisation and composition. I also enjoy dancing of various styles including popping, tutting, animation, krumping, c-walking, and more. In addition, I have various other interests in cooking, tea drinking, watches, and cars. Thanks for visiting!</p></div>
