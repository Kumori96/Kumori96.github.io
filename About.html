            <h2 class="about">About Me</h2>
            <h4 class="about">Kevin Chung</h4>
            <p class="about1">I’ve always surrounded myself in the tech world: building computers for fun, taking things apart, keeping up with new technology. Part of this vague passion may have been nurtured by my educational environment, in which I was given the opportunity to have great role models. Perhaps I had a natural affinity for all tech-related topics. It was not entirely clear what particular aspects of tech drew me in. Despite this lack of clarity, my interest in tech persisted and led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science at UC Davis. After receiving my education, I became more aware of what aspect of tech I truly enjoyed. Creative processes. All of my general interests had the commonality of being fundamentally creative. Now with my foundation in computer science, I plan to integrate my passion and intuition for design with my knowledge of its practicality and feasibility within the context of software engineering.</p>
            
            <p class="about2">Along the way I’ve picked up various hobbies that I’m passionate about and wish to share with those who are also interested!</p>
            
            <p class="about2">
            I’ve studied the piano for roughly 18 years with a background in classical and jazz styles. These days, I have been more focused on jazz improvisation and writing compositions inspired by various facets of my life.</p>
            
            <p class="about2">
            I’ve also been a self-taught dancer for 6 to 7 years, exploring different styles and dance philosophies (popping, tutting, animation, krumping, c-walking, etc.). For me, dancing was a way of understanding body movement, visual expression of music, and finding confidence in portraying oneself.</p>
            
            <p class="about2">
            Another hobby I take a great interest in is cooking. I found beauty in the complexity and harmony of bringing different flavors together and expressing a story on the plate. Creating new, enjoyable dishes and sharing them is one of my favorite ways to spend time.</p>
